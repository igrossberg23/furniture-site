# Chair Shop

This is a **simple, modern chair shopping page**. This project was created as part of [Build Responsive Real-World Websites with HTML and CSS](https://www.udemy.com/course/design-and-develop-a-killer-website-with-html5-and-css3/) by *Jonas Schmedtmann*.

The HTML and CSS for this project were written by me alongside the course instructor as a learning experience. This project does not include any Javascript. The focus is on the design of the page and the user experience.


### This page features the following:

- A simple, but effective *hero section* to draw the attention and immediately call the user to action with color focus on the buttons that generate business
- A sleek, modern design with generous use of white space and short, bold text sections
- Integration of products to guide the user to purchase right after the sales pitch
